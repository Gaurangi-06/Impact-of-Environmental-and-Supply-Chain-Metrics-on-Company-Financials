# Impact-of-Environmental-and-Supply-Chain-Metrics-on-Company-Financials

In this project our team examines the relationship between environmental practices, supply chain policies, and financial performance across diverse industries. The study analyzes a comprehensive dataset of 77,313 entries spanning multiple years, focusing on key environmental metrics such as recycling, waste management, pollution prevention, and product safety, alongside financial indicators including return on assets (ROA), revenue, and inventory management. The analysis reveals several significant findings. Companies implementing robust recycling and electronic waste management practices demonstrate higher revenues, while those maintaining strong product safety and quality standards show improved ROA performance. Additionally, companies with environmental controversies tend to maintain larger raw material inventories, possibly due to supply chain uncertainties and regulatory compliance requirements. The research also identified notable correlations between financial variables, particularly between total revenue and administrative expenses, as well as between capital expenditures and property, plant, and equipment metrics. The study's conclusions emphasize the growing importance of environmental sustainability in corporate strategy, suggesting that proactive environmental management practices not only fulfill regulatory requirements but also contribute to improved financial outcomes. This is particularly evident in the positive correlation between environmental initiatives and revenue generation, highlighting the business case for sustainable practices in modern corporate operations
